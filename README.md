Introduction

Autodesk Fusion 360 stores your designs in the cloud, but provides no official way to bulk download or archive your own files. If you want to downgrade your licence, leave Fusion entirely, or simply keep an offline backup, exporting designs one-by-one is slow, error-prone, and frustrating.

This tool solves that problem.

It is a Fusion 360 Python script that automatically walks your entire Fusion account — across all hubs, projects, and folders — and exports every design as a native .f3d archive. Each file is opened, exported, and closed safely, preserving your original folder structure and ensuring full design fidelity.

The result is a complete, local, offline archive of your Fusion designs that you fully control.

No conversions.
No cloud lock-in.
Just your data, backed up properly.
